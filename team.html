          <h2>Dr. Katlyn Turner</h2>
          <h3>Founder, Principal</h3>
          <p>Dr. Katlyn Turner (she/her) is the founder of KTLN Consulting. She started her research career working on technical and sociotechnical aspects of nuclear waste management and nuclear energy, which broadened into a research interest in sociotechnical systems, inequity, and intersectionality. At KTLN Consulting, Dr. Turnerâ€™s research explores the ways complex systems and technology often exacerbate social hierarchy and inequity. Dr. Turner is also a Research Scientist at the MIT Media Lab, a research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder, a research affiliate with the Data + Feminism Lab at MIT, and a research fellow in the blackbox Lab at Harvard University. She earned her PhD in Geological Sciences from Stanford University, where she researched novel nuclear waste forms. From 2017-2019, Katlyn was a postdoctoral fellow at the Project on Managing the Atom & the International Security Program at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science & International Affairs, where she researched environmental and socio-political impacts of nuclear energy. Dr. Turner additionally holds an M.S. in Earth & Environmental Sciences from the University of Michigan, and a B.S. in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.</p>

          <h2>Nina Lutz</h2>
          <h3>Founding Partner, Computational Research Lead</h3>
          <p>Nina Lutz (she/her) is a Founding Partner with KTLN Consulting. Lutz is formally trained as a Computer Scientist and Designer at MIT and holds an MS from the MIT Media Lab. Via KTLN she utilizes computational and qualitative methods to conduct critical landscape analyses and quantitative summarizations on sociotechnical systems and how they relate to environmental and climate justice and equity. Nina is an incoming PhD student at the University of Washington in the Center for Informed Public where she will explore how visual (mis/dis) information harms intersectionally marginalized individuals and groups both on and offline. She gravitates to any research that seeks to use quantitative and qualitative methods to explore complex sociotechnical systems and phenomena that are contributing to ubiquitous harms in and to oppressed groups and individuals.
